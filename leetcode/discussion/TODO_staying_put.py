Problem: Staying Put

You start at index 0 in an array with length 'h'.
At each step, you can move to the left,
move to the right, or stay in the same place
(Note: Stay in the same place also takes one step).
How many possible ways are you still at index 0 after you have walked 'n' step?

Exampleï¼š n = 3
1. right->left->stay
2. right->stay->left
3. stay->right->left
4. stay->stay->stay
