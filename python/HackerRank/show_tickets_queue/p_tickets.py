'''
There are n people standing in line to buy show tickets.
The venue sells tickets according to the following rules:
  a.The person at the head of the line can buy exactly one ticket and must then exit the line
  
  b.if a person needs to purchase additional tickets, they must re-enter the end of the line
  and wait to be sold their next ticket(assume exit and re-entry takes zero seconds).
  
  c.Each ticket sale takes exactly one second.
  We express initial line of n people as an array, tickets = [tickets0, tickets1 â€¦ ticketsN-1],
  where ticketsi denotes the number of tickets person I wishes to buy.
  If Jesse is standing at a position p in this line, find out how much time it would take for him to buy all tickets.

# interesting result:
# assume p < N
# Logic: for list of N items from [0 . . . N-1]
# When we pop the queue at any position k, add k-1 to the end of the list
# Assume when we pop 1, 0 is added to the end of the list and negative numbers
# are never added
# time for every pop is 1 second
# So, our list contains: [0, 1, 2, ..., p, ..., N-1]
# We can approach this problem by considering two lists (conjoined)
# One list [0, 1, 2, ..., p] (let's call L1) joined to [p+1, p+2, ..., N-1] (L2)
#
# Consider L1:
# it will first take p seconds for p will be at the start of the list
# after p seconds, queue = [p, 1, 2, ..., p-2]
# or after p+1 seconds, queue = [1, 2, ..., p-1]
# now it will take ((p+1)-1) seconds for p term of interest to be at the end of list
# Therefore, we have (p+1) + (p) + p-1 + ...
# sum total = ((p+1)(p+2))/2
#
# Consider L2:
# We have [p+1, p+2, ..., N-1]
# There are N-1-p (or N-p-1 elements in this list)
# L1 is "looped" (defined when pth variable is at the end of L1) p times
# As such for p'th object will traverse an extra p * (N-p-1) seconds
# Total = sum of t(L1) and t(L2) = ((p+1)(p+2))/2 + p(N-p-1) seconds
